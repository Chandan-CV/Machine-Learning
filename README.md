# Machine-Learning
these are some of the machine learning  codes which I came up with. I have not used any other AI packages 
well I would appreciaate people to build on this code.
This code has been Writen in java
and it would be awesome to make a Strong classifier by imporvising this prototype.
This is the nearest neighbour method.
This is  a package which can be used in any code for classifying by training the agorithm.
Here the Training data is ploted on a graph based on the inputs
A value to compare is taken by the user and it is compared to all the categories of the data plotted.
This then classifies the compare value to the nearest data.
All of this is done using distance formula.
